Since the biceps are a relatively small muscle, they do not require too many sets or movements to be properly trained. The key is to use extremely strict form. Due to the use of curling the arms to train the biceps, there is an opportunity and luring temptation to swing the weight up with your body. A solid biceps routine should consist of both compound and isolation movements. Proper and full contraction-extension is the way to stimulate growth in the biceps.",

As with biceps training, one should always add a compound movement along with an isolation movement. Close grip flat presses are great for building a foundation followed by and isolation movement such as triceps cable push downs which will hit all three heads.  ",
